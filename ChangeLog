2005-04-05  Brett Hutley  <brett@hutley.net>

	* src/rq/rq_yield_curve.c (rq_yield_curve_get_discount_factor):
	Changed this function so that it uses the default day count
	convention whenever it needs to imply a zero rate from the yield
	curve.
	(rq_yield_curve_get_simple_rate): This function now uses the
	default day count convention, and will return rate an annually
	compounded zero-coupon rate.
	(rq_yield_curve_set_default_day_count_convention): Added  (with get)

	* src/rq/rq_yield_curve.h: Added a default_day_count_convention
	member to struct rq_yield_curve, to be used whenever a rate is
	implied.

	* src/rq/rq_termstruct.c (rq_termstruct_get_type): Added.

	* src/rq/rq_rate_conversions.c (rq_rate_discount_to_zero): Added.
	(rq_rate_zero_to_discount): Added.

	* src/rq/rq_bootstrap_yield_curve_simple.c (rq_bootstrap_yield_curve_simple): See below.
	* src/rq/rq_bootstrap_yield_curve_composite.c (rq_bootstrap_yield_curve_composite): 
	I'm setting the default day count convention on the yield curve now,
	to be ACT/360 if the underlying currency asset has a days_per_year
	value of 360.

2005-04-04  Brett Hutley  <brett@hutley.net>
	** version 0.7.4 released
	
	* test/code/test_fixed_flows.c: New test added.

	* src/rq/rq_floating_flow.c (rq_floating_flow_set_payment_amount): 
	The payment amount on fixed rate flows is now calculated by dividing
	the rate by the number of payments per year.

	* src/rq/rq_date.c (rq_date_calc_periods_per_year): Added.

2005-03-31  Brett Hutley  <brett@hutley.net>

	* src/rq/rq_enum.c (rq_day_count_convention_from_string): Added.

	* src/rq/rq_day_count.c (rq_day_count_get_year_fraction): Minor
	fix to ACT/ACT.AFB

	* test/code/test_day_count.c (main): Improved the day count testing.

2005-03-31  Brett Hutley  <brett@hutley.net>

	** Released 0.7.3

	* src/rq/rq_day_count.c (rq_day_count_get_year_fraction): Worked
	on the day count functions some more - ACT/ACT.AFB and
	ACT/ACT.ISMA

	* src/rq/rq_floating_flow.c (rq_floating_flow_set_floating_rate_from_curve): 
	Fixed up a bracketing bug, where the function thought the rate was
	already set on the floating flow.

	* rq_termstruct.h: Added an underlying_asset_id member.
	* rq_termstruct.c: Created a function for setting the underlying
	asset ID, and also made sure the clear() function free's the
	underlying asset ID if one is set.

2004-10-07 Brett Hutley <brett@hutley.net>

	* src/rq/*.[ch]: Changed the way all objects are
	implemented. Instead of hiding the implementation details inside
	the c source file, the structure is now exposed in the header.
	
2004-02-10 Brett Hutley <brett@hutley.net>

	* configure.in, NEWS: Changed version to 0.6.22, updated NEWS
	
2003-08-26  Brett Hutley  <brett@hutley.net>

	* configure.in: Changed version to 0.6.2
	* ChangeLog: Converted to proper GNU-style ChangeLog format, and
	built the ChangeLog from my CVS comments.

2003-07-18  Brett Hutley  <brett@hutley.net>

	* ltmain.sh: ltmain.sh seems to be necessary for my OSX system to
	link. Changed rq_price_blackscholes.c to use getopt instead of the
	gnu getopt_long functions to support my BSD systems that don't
	have that installed by default.

2002-11-22  Brett Hutley  <brett@hutley.net>

	* riskquantify.dsw: Updated the win32 MSVC project file to get the
	list of source files right. Added a MSVC workspace in the root
	directory. Took out the RQ_EXPORT define from the .c files. I'm
	not sure if I should replace this with a .def file for the rqso
	MSVC dll project or not.

	* INSTALL: Forgot to checkin the INSTALL file.
	* README: Got 1st version of automake/autoconf producing a working
	configure script!
	* configure.in: OK, start of setting up the autoconf/automake
	stuff...
