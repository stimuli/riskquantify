Version 0.8.1 (2009-06-04)

* Merged in code from the Razor-Risk crew. Thanks for the updates!!

Version 0.7.9 (2008-04-03)

* Merged in lots of code/patches and bug-fixes from Todd Cooper,
  Hendra Arya Surya, Joey Nicotra, Dennis Hon, Jeremy Gates and
  Richard Lewis.

  NOTE: I've skipped some release numbers. There were lots of changes to
  code in this release. I'm preparing for a 0.8.0 release.

Version 0.7.6 (2006-01-03)

* Added a rq_tree_rb_remove() function so that we can remove nodes
from the red-black tree. Also it doesn't seem as though an in-order
insertion of keys into the tree would actually produce a balanced
tree. I've fixed this up.

* Added a new test_tree_rb test for testing red-black trees.

* Added generic iterator support to most of the container classes.

* Added some matrix functions.

* Added a poisson random number function.

* Started a multi-factor monte carlo pricing function.

Version 0.7.5 (2005-04-05)

* Yield curves when interpolating or extrapolating rates using
  zero-coupon rates, now have a default day count convention, which is
  usually set to either ACT/365 (default) or ACT/360. The simple yield
  curve bootstrapper and composite yield curve bootstrapper set this
  value based on the days_per_year value of the underlying currency on
  the yield curve.

  Additive and Multiplicative factors are now applied to rates
  calculated using the appropriate day count fraction.

* There is also a new helper function rq_termstruct_get_type() to
  determine what kind of term structure one is dealing with.

* There are some helper functions in rq_rate_conversions.c to go from
  a discount factor to an annual compounding zero-coupon rate and back
  again.

Version 0.7.4 (2005-04-01)

* The payment amount on fixed rate flows is now calculated by dividing
  the rate by the number of payments per year (currently calculated by
  using the days in the period). If a periods_per_year value cannot be
  worked out, the day count convention is used.

* A minor bug-fix to ACT/ACT.AFB

Version 0.7.3 (2005-03-31)

* Every term structure now has an underlying asset ID.

* A bracketing bug has been fixed in the rq_floating_flow code, which
  was stopping it rate setting properly.

* ACT/ACT.ISMA and ACT/ACT.AFB day count conventions have been
  added. These still have to be properly tested.

Version 0.7.2 (2005-03-30)

* Fixed up a bug in using additive factors in the yield curve.

  Worked on the rq_yc cmd line program - it should be nearly ready to go!

  Worked on day_count factors.

  Got interpolation and extrapolation on yield curves working using a
  few different methods

Version 0.7.1 (2005-03-16)

* Lots of work done on term structures, floating flows, day count
  conventions, roll conventions, and calendars!

  There was a bug fix done for calculating the number of months
  between dates in rq_date_month_diff.

  I've added a new type - rq_floating_flow - for storing the
  information needed to value asset-flow-based trades such as swaps or
  bonds.

  I've added functions for calculating day count fractions according
  to the different conventions (in rq_day_count).

  I've added functions for calculating the different roll dates
  according to the different conventions.

  I've also changed the roll date calculation functions so they can
  take a list of calendars instead of only one.

  I've extended rq_yield_curve so it can support being a composite
  yield curve on two other yield curves.

  I've *started* to extend rq_calendar to support composite calendars.

  I've added the weekend dates to the rq_calendar object, in order to
  support calendars that DON'T have Saturday and Sunday as weekends.

  I've fixed up one bug in the rq_tree_rb_clone() function.

  I've made the first part of any term structure object
  (rq_yield_curve, rq_forward_curve, etc) be a standard rq_termstruct
  type. This is so there can be standard routines to determine what
  KIND of term structure a generic termstructure object is.

Version 0.7.0 (2004-10-08)

* I have changed Risk Quantify so objects are no longer opaque. Now
  the structure of each object in Risk Quantify is specified in the
  file header. This means that it's a lot easier to see how objects
  are implemented (making it easier for new coders to get to grips
  with the different objects), and also makes it easier to debug.

  The consequence of this is that programs that were accessing or
  assigning RQ objects by using the void * "p" member of the RQ object
  structure will have to change the code. The return values from
  object alloc calls and the first parameter to object functions are
  direct pointers to the object structures themselves.

Version 0.6.23 (2004-05-21)

* I've added a variant type and a named variant manager. 
* Fixed a bug in the rq_forward_curve.
* Added a rq_string_set object.

Version 0.6.22 (2004-02-10)

* I've added an "external" term structure type, to support the ability
  to build term structures that Risk Quantify knows nothing about.

Version 0.6.21 (2003-11-07)

* The code to call the pricing adapter initialization function after
  loading had been commented out of the pricing engine.

Version 0.6.20 (2003-10-24)

* Generalized rq_asset_base_metal and rq_asset_precious_metal with
  rq_asset_commodity

Version 0.6.19 (2003-10-20)

* Some work on partial barrier models, equity bermudans
* Started an rq_iterator_t type to make all iterations standard.

Version 0.6.18 (2003-10-08)

* Some bugfixing on adding a rq_forward_curve
* Added a basic test harness for forward curves.

Version 0.6.17 (2003-10-01)

* I've added a bootstrap adapter for spread curves

* I've added a function to add a message to the rq_pricing_result
  structure using a printf() style format

Version 0.6.16 (2003-09-29)

* I've added the ability to request an expected forward stock price.

Version 0.6.15 (2003-09-22)

* I've added some iteration to the rq_bootstrap_config_mgr (bah)

* I've added some insertion and removal routines to the rq_vector code
  (bah)

Version 0.6.14 (2003-09-17)

* I've fixed a bug in the calendar code, that occurs when adding more
  than 40 holidays. (bah)

* I've fixed a bug in the rq_bootstrap_adapter_equity_curve_simple
  where the bootstrap adapter had the wrong bootstrap adapter
  ID. (bah)

Version 0.6.13 (2003-09-12) 

* I fixed up a problem with the rq_defs.h file (I included the type in
  the RQ_DOUBLE_EQUAL macro, so it didn't build under MSVC).

Version 0.6.12 (2003-09-12) 

* I've changed the interface to the pricing adapter. Now to get the
face value of a trade, you make a call to get_pricing_results.

Version 0.6.11 (2003-09-11)

 * I've started updating the NEWS file again!! (bah)
 * I've added a rq_rate_type_from_string function to rq_enum. (bah)
 * I've got "make distcheck" building all the way through (bah)

2002-07-18 Risk Quantify is moving to 'configure' (bah)
